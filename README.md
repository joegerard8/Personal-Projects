# Personal-Projects
A few personal projects I have completed. 
grouppokemon.py is a project I completed for a class, which entailed creating a simplified Pokemon battle simulator. 
tictactoe.py is a program I made for a job application. It allows the user to play Tic Tac Toe against a bot in the terminal.
PostgreSQL and Pandas Project is another project I made for a class. It demonstrates my ability to use pandas dataframes and PostgreSQL to analyze data.
I am curremtly working on various projects which I will add as I complete them. 
Enjoy!
